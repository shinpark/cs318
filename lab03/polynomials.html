            <p>
                If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equations, 
                then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the 
                four simplest orders:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Constant</dt>
                <dd>
                    Constant polynomial have the form a.
                </dd>
                <dt>Linear</dt>
                <dd>
                    Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x &plus; b.
                </dd>
                <dt>Quadratic</dt>
                <dd>
                    Quadratic polymonials have the form a &times; x<Sup>2</Sup> &plus; b &times; x &plus; c.
                </dd>
                <dt>Cubic</dt>
                <dd> 
                    Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x<Sup>3</Sup> &plus; b &times; x<sup>2</sup> &plus; c &times; x &plus; d. 
                </dd>
