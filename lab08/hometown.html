            <p>Meet the biggest underestimated place in the north. A dramatic riverfront skyline, three professional sports
                    stadiums within 1.3 miles, so much art you’re literally surrounded by it and a theater on almost every corner.
                    A culture committed to perfecting the craft of the brew, the best park system in the nation, and a foodie
                    paradise where you can get Nordic cuisine for breakfast, Ethiopian for lunch and this thing called a “Jucy
                    Lucy” for dinner – and oh yeah, cocktails on a Ferris wheel. A place to bring your dancing shoes and party
                    at festivals all year round, enjoy four gorgeous seasons surrounded by 13 lakes, the Mississippi River and
                    a waterfall, and meet friendly locals who can’t wait to show you why they love living here.</p>
