                Travel can be stressful, 
                for a lot of reasons. But some stress can be preempted. 
                Whenever you leave the house for more than a few days, you should do these things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Turn off the water to all toilets. You never know what they'll do while you're gone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste in your carry-on. If your suitcase gets lost, your mouth feels it first.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clean everything, so that no one can enjoy it while you're gone.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
