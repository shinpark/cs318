        <div class="name">Celebi</div>
        <p>Celebi is seen in the future, where she originally helped Grovyle escape to the present to collect Time Gears. Celebi
            can travel short distances through time all by herself, but for big trips of many generations, she uses the Passage
            of Time at the end of Deep Dusk Forest. She does not like the everlasting darkness of the future, and is willing
            to sacrifice herself to get rid of the planet's paralysis.</p>

        <div class="name">Charizard</div>
        <p>Charizard appears as a Pokémon that can be randomly summoned from a Poké Ball. When Charizard appears, it attacks

            to right. The attack deal 6% damage per flame in both games.</p>

        <div class="name">Pikachu-PhD</div>
        <p>In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, after the first time the player takes part in a Pokémon Contest Spectacular,
            an NPC will give the player Cosplay Pikachu because she says it matches their costume; the Cosplay Pikachu she
            gives the player will be in the Pikachu Rock Star costume for male players or the Pikachu Pop Star costume for
            female players. When obtained, Cosplay Pikachu will have its Hidden Ability and its Contest condition in each
            category is equally elevated. Cosplay Pikachu cannot be Shiny.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/a6/Jigglypuff_SSB4.png">
        <div class="name">Jigglypuff</div>
        <p>Jigglypuff is a playable character, but it must be unlocked by clearing the 1-Player mode with any character. Jigglypuff
            has one of the best recoveries in the game and can use its low-power aerial attacks to combo larger and heavier
            opponents easily, but it also the lightest character and thus very easy to knock off the stage. Jigglypuff shares
            the Saffron City stage with Pikachu.</p>

        <div class="name">Wigglytuff</div>
        <p>Even as an Igglybuff of young age, Wigglytuff was considered a prodigy in exploring by an Armaldo that he discovered
            and befriended. Seeing him as a mentor and friend, Igglybuff called him "master" repeatedly, even when Armaldo
            told him to stop. Much like his older and evolved self, he was very carefree and naïve to the point of befriending
            the local bullies, Skorupi and Banette.</p>

        <div class="name">Nuzleaf</div>
        <p>Nuzleaf, named as Mr. Nuzleaf by the player, serves as the father figure after rescuing the player character from the 
            attack of three Beheeyem. He then takes the player home to Serene Village, but is later revealed to have been deceiving 
            the player from the beginning in order to achieve his plans. He is a secondary antagonist who is involved in turning Pokémon 
            to stone, but is later revealed to have been controlled by Dark Matter.</p>
