            <h3>How much will the COLA amount be for 2018 and when will I receive it?</h3>
            <p>Monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for over 
                66 million Americans will increase 2.0 percent in 2018. The Social Security Act ties 
                the annual cost-of-living (COLA) to the increase in the Consumer Price Index as determined 
                by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
            <h3>Does Social Security offer special services to disaster victims?</h3>
            <p>Yes.  We understand how devastating and disorienting things can be when disaster strikes. 
                That’s why we offer expedited handling of Social Security services for disaster victims.

                We will follow our special Disaster Procedures in handing your Social Security service needs.</p>
            <h3>How do I apply for a new or replacement Social Security number card?</h3>
            <p>You can get an original Social Security card or a replacement card if yours is lost or stolen. 
                There is no charge for a Social Security card. This service is free.</p>
