            <h3>I Will Be Your God</h3>
            <h4>Jeremiah 7:1-8:3</h4>
            <h4>Key verse: Jeremiah 7:23</h4>
            <p>1. If you really change your ways (7:1-19)</p>
            <p>The temple made God's people feel safe. But they worshiped and lived as they pleased. God said, "Reform your
                ways and actions" (3). He told them to really change their ways and stop worshiping idols and breaking God's
                commands. They made the temple a den of robbers (11). They worshiped a Babylonian goddess ("Queen of Heaven")
                to their own shame (18-19).</p>
            <p>2. That it may go well with you (7:20-8:3)</p>
            <p>God wanted them to walk in obedience to his commands, then he would be their God and they would be his people
                (23). But they followed their evil hearts instead (24). God sent them prophets, but they didn't listen (25-26).
                When we don't obey the Lord or respond to correction, truth perishes (28). Idolatry trades joy and gladness
                for desolation (34). Worshiping created things ends in shame (8:2).</p>
            <p>Prayer: Lord, help us to really change our ways, obeying you from our hearts, not just having the appearance
                of godliness. You are our God and we are your people.</p>
            <p>One word: I will be your God and you will be my people</p>
