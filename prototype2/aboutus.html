            <p><img src="Images/ubf-logo-sign.jpg" alt="homeimageslides" id="conpic"> The University Bible Fellowship Church (UBF) began as a student movement in Korea in September of 1961, during a time of national turmoil. Discouraged by the political and economic situation of Korea after the civil war, students were wandering without direction for their lives. At that time, God brought together Pastor Samuel Lee and Missionary Sarah Barry. Samuel Lee was a Presbyterian pastor with a passion for helping young people. Sarah Barry was a missionary sent by the Board of World Missions of the Southern Presbyterian Church, USA, who came seeking a way to help the war-devastated Korean people with the Bible. Together they shared a common belief that the best way to help Korea and the world was to plant faith in Christ and hope for the future in the hearts of college students who could grow to be future leaders. Initially, many students were drawn by English Bible study. Through prayer and deep Bible study, the ministry quickly grew into a grass roots movement of Christian students.
            </p>
            <p>At the heart of this movement was a love for God’s word, the Bible. Also, central to this movement was prayer and an emphasis on the gospel of Jesus. Pastor Lee spent every morning in deep Bible study. Students grew as disciples of Jesus through writing Bible reflections. In this way, the ministry was Bible-based, Christ-centered and focused on World Mission in response to Jesus’ command to make disciples of all nations (Mt 28:19).
            </p>
            <p>Today, UBF is a global ministry that has chapters in 96 countries. Our UBF missionaries still seek to obey Jesus’ Great Commission to make disciples of all nations. As lay missionaries, they live with a sacrificial spirit and a giving spirit. College students remain at the forefront of the ministry. Students take an active role in the ministry as they share their faith with others. UBF is committed to making disciples of Jesus Christ, with an emphasis on world mission. Christmas offerings are donated for world relief purposes. UBF has also participated in the establishment of the Bethesda Medical Center in Uganda, which is engaged in a healing and disciple-making ministry.

            <p>University Bible Fellowship is an international evangelical church and ministry. Our main focus is to help college students to study the Bible and live according to its teachings. We labor and pray to raise lifelong disciples of Jesus among college students who trust in Christ and seek to live by his grace, obeying his commandments (e.g. Jn 13:34; Mt 28:18-20). UBF serves world evangelism by raising lay missionaries and sending them throughout the world.
