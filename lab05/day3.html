            <h2>Feb 20, 2021</h2>
            <h3>Visit in the off season. Peak season in Venice means large crowds, expensive hotel rooms and restaurants 
                hiking up their prices. For a great deal, plan on visiting Venice during the months of September and 
                October  for mild weather and lower prices. Carnival – which falls between March and April each year –
                 is a great period to visit, but may bring higher hotel prices. Winter months are significantly cheaper 
                 than summer, but the risk of acqua alta (high water) flooding may not be for everyone 
                 (read more about Acqua Alta here).</h3>

            <h3>Choose a family run B and B or rent a short-term apartment.  Skip the large hotels and opt for a family owned bed and 
                breakfast for a cozy and budget friendly stay. We recommend 3749 Ponte Chiodo or renting your own 
                apartment through rental sites like AirBnb.  Need help deciding which neighborhood to stay in? Check 
                out our guide of the city’s sestieri.</h3>
