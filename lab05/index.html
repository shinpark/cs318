            <h1>There and Back Again</h1>
            <p>We took a two week bacpacking trip through Italy. And during our two week trip we went to 
                four different cities. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="day1.html"> Day 1: </a>A brief trip to Florence, Italy</li>
                <li><a href="day2.html"> Day 2: </a>A brief trip to Rome, Italy</li>
                <li><a href="day3.html"> Day 3: </a>A brief trip to Venice, Italy</li>
                <li><a href="day4.html"> Day 4: </a>A brief trip to Pisa, Italy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We really enjoyed our trip and had an amazing time with memories we will never forget. 
                Our favorite city was Venice because of the beautiful water and a ride in a gondola. 
                All in all, we highly reccomend Italy as a travel destination.
