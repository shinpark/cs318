            <h3>I went to the Medici Dynasty Show at their new location in an old Church on via faenza. 
                This one hour show showcases 300 years of Florentine history focusing on two members of 
                the famous Medici family. The script has undergone a revamp by Marissa Greffy and check 
                out the personalized jewelry by Sara Amrhein available for purchase. Highly recommend 
                doing this on your next trip to Florence!</h3>

            <h3>I shopped at.. Betty Soldi’s And Company shop which moved locations (across the street) 
                with a beautiful new array of awesome souvenirs (also for yourself). I love the marble 
                “Firenze” plaque and her new “Inkspired” book with calligraphy worksheets, inspirational 
                quotes and her beautiful new book “Inkspired” offering a chance to put a pen to paper 
                again and soak in her beautiful wisdom.

                    Nico got me a wonderful ‘eco watch’ from a cool store called MIO on via della spada 
                    34. Here you can find up-cycled recycled objects from young local designers including
                     jewelry, sustainable objects, crumpled maps, and even items from local street artist 
                     Clet, it is a definitely cool space and they take great care on what they choose to
                      sell in the shop. Perfect for gifts (to yourself too).
                    
                    ps. I am currently working on a San Frediano neighborhood guide to further showcase 
                    what I adore about this area of Florence.</h3>
