            <h2>Feb 15, 2021</h2>
            <h3>It is hard to know what your life is going to look like when you are 25 years old. (Full disclaimer: 
                it’s still hard). But when I moved to Rome many years ago, I honestly could never have imagined 
                what I would find here.

                    Not only a city to love, but also a wonderful (Irish!) man.
                    
                    We have built our life in Rome, figuring out step-by-step how we wanted it to look.
                     We adopted a crazy cat, moved to Testaccio, got married and changed careers.
                    
                    Because coming into your own adulthood isn’t difficult enough, we chose to do it in 
                    another language with a new culture as a backdrop.
                    
                    It is strange to reflect on how much has changed because I can still remember the
                     airport shuttle pulling up in front of my first Roman apartment. I remember the equal 
                     parts of terror and exhilaration that I experienced as I opened the door.
                    
                    Planning to stay for a year, I simply did not know how full my life would become because 
                    of that one decision to take the leap and try out life in Italy.
                    
                    I’m from California and my husband is from Ireland, but our little boy will always be from 
                    Rome.</h3>

            <h3>Previously a movie theater, the space has been remade into a cool music venue, restaurant and bar in
                 the heart of this popular Rome neighborhood.

                    Rather than erasing the building’s past, Live Alcazar has maintained many of the best
                     attributes, helping the venue to feel like an intimate 
                    theater. Nods to the building’s first incarnation include red velvet movie theater seats
                     that can be pulled out during the concerts.</h3>
