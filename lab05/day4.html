            <h3>Pisa, oh Pisa why do I not give you enough attention? This city on the sea seems to be most famous to many 
                Florentines as the place where you get your ryanair flights and of course the famous leaning tower of Pisa. 
                That being said, there is really much more to the city by the sea and I have a special soft spot in my heart 
                for bella Pisa after a blog tour a few year’s ago during the Internet Festival that opened my eyes to what 
                this city has to offer. People tend to not really give Pisa a chance, which is pretty sad because I always 
                have a great time exploring the city which I know other people would too, if they think beyond the tower.</h3>

            <h3>We hopped on a less-than-clean Trenitalia train and make our way to Pisa centrale in a little more than an hour. 
                For some reason many people seem to think you need to take a bus to the tower or the center but if you don’t mind 
                walking 20 minutes or so, you really don’t need to do that. Just pass Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II and continue along
                 Corso Italia from the front of the train station which leads you into the center of town (and in front of a lot of
                  stores). We stopped at the mural of Keith Haring titled ‘Tuttomondo’ {close to the train station} to snap a few
                   pics and gaze at this pure awesomeness.

                    This 180 square meter mural covers the south wall of the church or St. Anthony and was completed in 1989 
                    after a young Pisan student met Keith on the streets of New York. What’s cool is that each figure depicted
                     represents a different aspect of peace in the world. We decided to have some mimicking some of the characters</h3>
